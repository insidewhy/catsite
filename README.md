A website written in python/polymer to let you control some household sockets via an [energenie pimote control](https://energenie4u.co.uk/index.phpcatalogue/product/ENER002-2PI) and view footage from a [raspberry pi camera](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/).

Ideal for deterring burglars and keeping an eye on your things while you're on holiday.
